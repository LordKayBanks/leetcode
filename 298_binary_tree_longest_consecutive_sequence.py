# 298: Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence

# Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.

# The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. 
# The longest consecutive path need to be from parent to child (cannot be the reverse).

# For example,
# 	
#    1
#     \
#      3
#     / \
#    2   4
#         \
#          5

# Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.
	
#    2
#     \
#      3
#     / 
#    2    
#   / 
#  1

# Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3,not 3-2-1, so return 2.

        There are three parameters of helper function, prev (the previous node), cur (the current node) 
        and length (the accumulated length before cur). 
        If cur.val == prev.val + 1, then we can continue exploring the current nodeâ€™s children with length increased by 1. 
        Otherwise, refresh length. 
 
        The time complexity in the worst case will always be O(N) where N is the number of tree nodes.
